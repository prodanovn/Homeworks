### Intro to Programming

1. Create, compile and run a “Hello C#” console application. 

2. Modify the previous application to print your name. 

3. Create console application that prints your first and last name, each at a separate line.

4. Write a program to print the numbers 1, 101 and 1001, each at a separate line.

5.  Write a program to read your birthday from the console and print how old you are now and how old you will be after 10 years.

6. Create a console application that prints the current date and time. Find out how in Internet. 

7. Reformat the following C# code to make it readable according to the C# best practices for code formatting.
Change the casing of the identifiers in the code (e.g. use PascalCase for the class name): HorribleCode.cs 

```C#
namespace reformatCode
{
    using sysTem;
    class            reformatcode {
        static void 
        Main()
        {
            Console. WriteLine ("Hi, I am horribly formatted program!")  ; 
            Console.WriteLine("Numbers and squares:");
            for (int number = 0; 
            number < 10; 
            number++) {
                Console
                .WriteLine(number + " --> " + number * number);}
        }
    }
}
```

8. Create a console application that calculates and prints the square root of the number 12345.

9. Write a program that prints the first 10 members of the sequence: 2, -3, 4, -5, 6, -7, ...

10. Write a program that prints the first 1000 members of the sequence: 2, -3, 4, -5, 6, -7, …
