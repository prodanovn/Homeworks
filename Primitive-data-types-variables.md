### Primitive data types and Variables

1. Declare a Boolean variable called isFemale and assign an appropriate value corresponding to your gender.
Print it on the console.

2. Declare two integer variables a and b and assign them with 
5 and 10 and after that exchange their values by using some programming logic.
Print the variable values before and after the exchange.

3. Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate of the types 
byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong to represent the following values: 52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000.
Choose a large enough type for each number to ensure it will fit in it. Try to compile the code.

4. Create a program that assigns null values to an integer and to a double variable.
Try to print these variables at the console.
Try to add some number or the null literal to these variables and print the result.

5. Write a program that safely compares floating-point numbers (double) with precision eps = 0.000001.
Note: Two floating-point numbers a and b cannot be compared directly by a == b because of the nature 
of the floating-point arithmetic. Therefore, we assume two numbers are equal if they are more closely 
to each other than a fixed constant eps.

6. Which of the following values can be assigned to a variable of type float and which to a variable 
of type double: 34.567839023, 12.345, 8923.1234857, 3456.091?
Write a program to assign the numbers in variables and print them to ensure no precision is lost.

7. Declare two string variables and assign them with following value: The "use" of quotations causes difficulties.
Do the above in two different ways - with and without using quoted strings.
Print the variables to ensure that their value was correctly defined.

8. Declare two string variables and assign them with Hello and World.
Declare an object variable and assign it with the concatenation of the first two variables (mind adding an interval between).
Declare a third string variable and initialize it with the value of the object variable (you should perform type casting).
9. Find online more information about ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
and write a program that prints the entire ASCII table of characters on the console (characters from 0 to 255).
Note: Some characters have a special purpose and will not be displayed as expected. 
You may skip them or display them differently.

10. Declare a character variable and assign it with the symbol that has
Unicode code 42 (decimal) using the \u00XX syntax, and then print it.

11. Declare an integer variable and assign it with the value 254 in hexadecimal format (0x##).
Use Windows Calculator to find its hexadecimal representation.
Print the variable and ensure that the result is 254.

12. A bank account has a holder name (first name, middle name and last name), available amount of mo (balance), bank name, IBAN, 3 credit card numbers associated with the account.
Declare the variables needed to keep the information for a single bank account using the appropriate data types and descriptive names.

13. A marketing company wants to keep record of its employees. Each record would have the following characteristics:
First name //Last name //Age (0...100) //Gender (m or f) //Personal ID number (e.g. 8 306 112 507) 
Unique employee number (27560000â€¦27569999) //Declare the variables needed to keep the information for a 
single employee using appropriate primitive data types. Use descriptive names. Print the data at the console.
